## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming convention



### What I learned

My main goal while building this was to incorporate a better naming convention for my classes. I researched the BEM naming convention and found it very useful. This is something I will use going forward. 

I also used a reset style sheet to make the project more consistent across multiple browsers.

### Continued development

How to handle text on different screen sizes is something I need to focus on more going forward and I want to continue to create better structured css files e.g naming conventions 


### Useful resources

- https://getbem.com/ - This helped me create a more structured stylesheet and made my code more reusable.
- https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/ - This is the reset style sheet I used and found very helpful. Something I will use going forward on most projects.
